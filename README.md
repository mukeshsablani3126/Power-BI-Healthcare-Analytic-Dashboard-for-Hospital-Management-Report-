# Power-BI-Healthcare-Analytic-Dashboard-for-Hospital-Management-Report-


A healthcare project where I developed a comprehensive data visualization solution using Power BI for a hospital management team. 

The goal was to create an interactive tool that tracks and analyzes patient visits, instrument availability, and revenue from different age groups. Additionally, the tool provides insights into patient wait times, feedback on doctors’ prescriptions, and overall hospital services.

Using MS Excel as the data source, I performed various data transformations in Power Query Editor, ensuring consistency and accuracy. I then designed a data model to establish relationships between key datasets like bed details, staff details, and departmental information.

To meet the hospital’s needs, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) using card visuals and a range of interactive visuals like bar charts, line charts, and maps. I also implemented drill-down and drill-through features, along with filters and slicers, to help the management team explore data more deeply. The project ultimately provided a centralized information hub, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved hospital operations.
